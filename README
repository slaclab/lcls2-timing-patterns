Repository for TPG timing pattern data.  Includes tools for simulating, validating, and programming timing patterns.

patterns: Directory of available patterns.  Includes

  description.txt           - textual description of pattern
  			    - it might be sufficient to just list the generating python functions 
			      and input parameters
  allow_d[0-13]_[0-13].py   - allow sequence python per destination
  allow_d[0-13]_[0-13].json - dictionary of description, encoding, and maxQ for each beam class
  			    - The maxQ array is used for re-classifying an allow sequence when
			      the bunch charge is changed.  In practice, this simply means
			      changing the beam class value associated with the sequence in 
			      the allow table.
  d[0-13].py                - destination beam requests python
  d[0-13].json              - dictionary of description, encoding, and title
  c[0-17].py                - control requests python
  c[0-17].json              - dictionary of description, encoding, and title
  ctrl.json                 - dictionary of control requests by bucket
  ctrl_stats.json           - statistics of { rate, first/last bucket, min/max spacing } per sequence bit
  dest.json                 - dictionary of beam requests by bucket per beam class combo
  dest_stats.json           - statistics of { rate, first/last bucket, min/max spacing } per beam class combo
  

pcdef.py - python dictionary of power class defining parameters

tools: python utilities for generation, simulation, execution, validation

  generation:

  simulation:
    individual:
      calculate statistics for validation { 1sec sum, min spacing, max spacing }

    pattern:
      read pattern directory and simulate across all inputs
      outputs are { beam requests, PC0[Allowed,Generated], PC1[], ... } per destination
        gets written to "pattern/validation.dat"
        plots for timeslot range, PC settings per destination
    visualization:
      inputs are { timeslot mode [AC/Fixed], timeslot range }

  execution:
    GUI tells HLA to execute pattern which includes entire subdirectory of sequences
    maps to facility modes (destn)
    given charge, determine PC of allow table sequences
      program allow table [ register array of sub-sequence start addr and pattern PC,
      	      	            indexed by MPS asserted PC ]
      requires min separation and max bunches within PC window for each allow sequence
      (from simulation)

  validation:
    other IOC executing on special node takes validation.dat and confirms for each
      destination when PC does not change
    errors can be trapped and archived
      { timestamp, pulseid, fixed/ac rates, beam request, mps status }

  scripts:
    patterngenerator.py --output <dir>
      Generates destination programming sequences for patterns described within
      a dictionary in patterngenerator.py.  Products are placed in <dir>/<pattern_name>/.

    patternprogrammer.py --pattern <pattern subdirectory> --pv <TPG PV base>
      Programs all sequences for the pattern and executes

    seqplot.py --start <bucket> --stop <bucket> <sequence.py>
      PyQt plot of (trigger bits vs) buckets populated

    seqprogram.py <sequence.py> <TPG sequence engine PV>
      Programs an individual sequence engine

    seqsim.py --pattern <pattern subdirectory> --start <bucket> --stop <bucket> --mode <CW/AC>
      Simulate 

    patternbrowser.py --path <dir>
      GUI for viewing statistics and display of destination, control by bucket
      for any setting of MPS beam classes

    patterntester.py --path <dir> --mps_port <port> ...
      GUI for programming a pattern into TPG and comparing live rates/sum with
      simulated pattern results for any setting of MPS beam classes.  Depends
      upon mpssim_tst to simulate MPS input.

    patterntest_auto.py --path <dir> --mps_port <port> ...
      Command line utility to loop through all patterns and MPS class
      combinations for validating live rates/sums against simulated results.
